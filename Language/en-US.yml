Cap'n, because it was preserved very nicely, brainers managed to find lots of documentation. To be honest, we won't be able to reproduce something like this anytime soon, even for 600 years old relic it is very advanced: IR cameras, cannon turrets, SAM sites, radar, holding cells, workshop, medbay and even small lab. And massive blast door that makes hangar nearly indestructible, but very difficult and expensive to repair.{NEWLINE}Resilience: 4. Indestructible. Requires: Seagull Launchers *4. When hangar is sealed, production/research services aren't available."

Or rather, why we, pirates, should we choose something in the first place, when we can just take everything? Using strength of the Gals along with all the scattered junk that is just lying around without any use and under precise guidance of the Brainers, we can 'connect' all the holes into one big hole through sheer creativity of the violence. The thing is Cap'n that results aren't guaranteed. Hell, let alone results, the consequences might be just as dire as results, if not way more cataclysmic.

After waking up, we've discovered a lot of... misplaced... things around our base, in addition to damage of various degrees.{NEWLINE}[+1000 Infamy, +10 Mad Scribblings, +50 Big Rocks, +50 Junk Piles, +25 Cleaning Bills, -$100,000]"
  STR_LIMITLESS_ANOMALY_EVENT: "Impossible Anomaly Stabilizes"
  STR_LIMITLESS_ANOMALY_EVENT_DESC: "The Anomaly seems to be running out of energy, its dreamlike qualities receding and everything becoming more physical. The massive ship inside the Anomaly, adorned by multiple compartments is looking almost completely normal now. Inside it we've found the library and its interesting contents, including 4 'Codex' books of different colors. There was also the Captain's Quarters with a snazy uniform and 3 Gal-sized space suits, filled to the brim Armory and the MedBay full of various equipment, including 3 occupied pods. There also was a shortie stranger inside ship! She didn't resist arrest. We think the anomaly can be completely collapsed by sucking out the rest of its energy through high voltage cables."
